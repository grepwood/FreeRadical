FreeRadical
===========

FreeRadical is a free software game engine hoping to accurately immitate that of Fallout 2.

This engine will also feature support for FFmpeg and APNG, so that new mods for Fallout 2 will not need to be using old and obscure formats like RIX, FRM, MVE and PAL. In result, this will also allow to break the boundary of indexed 256 color graphics within a 24bit palette, which will allow new graphics to have a lot greater picture quality.
