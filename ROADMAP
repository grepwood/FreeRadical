Current concerns:
	** provide an example config even if it has low-level stuff like DMA and IRQ settings for sound devices, we'll just ignore them and rely on SDL2
	** define config settings for this engine such as fullscreen, resolution, etc
	* extract something meaningful out of a DAT2
	* draft a DAT2+ that does not use obsolete and obscure formats and is generally easier to work with
	** like have images in PNG and APNG rather than FRM and RIX and use PAL to brighten up int24 pixels
	* draft a DAT2 handler where the compression byte can be set to a value higher than 0x01 to indicate different (and likely superior) compression than zlib
	* play the actual Fallout 2 more and document observed behavior

Stuff that has been dealt with:
	* displaying splash screens in SDL2
	* determining host endianess at runtime (useful in handling gamedata and running on ppc32 and arm)
	* optimized endian swaps using compiler intrinsics
	* cutscene playback
	** needs improvement - add automatic player quit when cutscene is at an end
	* config reader and writer
	* audio playback with libacm, with mono prediction
