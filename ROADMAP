Current concerns:
    * make SDL2 surface
    * playing the intros on that surface (will need stuff from ffmpeg)
    ** justify relying on ffmpeg: maybe add support for cutscenes encoded in webm and Ogg?
    * read and alter fallout2 config files
    ** provide an example config even if it has low-level stuff like DMA and IRQ settings for sound devices, we'll just ignore them and rely on SDL2
    ** define config settings for this engine such as fullscreen, resolution, etc
    * extract something meaningful out of a DAT2
    * draft a DAT2 handler where the compression byte can be set to a value higher than 0x01 to indicate different (and likely superior) compression than zlib
    * play the actual Fallout 2 more and document observed behavior
